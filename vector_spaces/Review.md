# Review
1. A linear combination is a bunch of vectors added up, each with a coefficient.
2. A coefficient is a scalar multiplier.
3. The span of vectors are all the possible linear combinations of those vectors.
4. The standard generators for some Field^n are the set of vectors that are zero except for a single component that contains the field's identity value. Each vector has the identity value in a different component of the vector.
5. Flat examples: point, line, plane
6. A homogenous linear equation is a linear equation where one side is the field's annihilator.
7. A homgenous linear system is a system of homogenous linear equations.
8. Two kinds of flat-containing-the-origin representations:
  - a homogenous linear system
  - a vector space (a span of vectors)
  correction: a homogenous linear system is actually a vector space. both homogenous linear systems and a span of vectors are vector spaces and can also represents flats through the origin.
9. A vector space is a category with these rules of composition:
  - the zero vector is contained (some annihilator value)
  - closed under scalar multiplication
  - closed under vector addition
10. A subspace is subset of a vector space that remains a vector space.
11. An affine combination is a linear combination where all the coefficients sum to 1.
12. An affine hull is all the affine combinations of a set of vectors
13. An affine space is a vector represented as a vector space translated by a specific vector
14. An affine space and the solution set of a system of linear equations can represent a flat not containing the origin.
15. a solution set of a linear system is an affine space when it isn't the empty set.
