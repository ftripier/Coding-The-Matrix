# problem 9.2.5
# just as a lazy hand-wavy proof because I'm hungry,
# we can prove classical_project_orthogonal and project_orthogonal are
# equivalent by a proof of induction on 
# i ÆŽ N
# where for a set of vectors of size k
# project_orthogonal^i == classical_project_orthogonal^(k - i)
# where we are free to rearrange vectors in classical_project_orthogonal by commutativity
# of vector addition.
# for example, at i == 1, we've subtracted one iteration from b, and
# we are one iteration away from having completed classical_project_orthogonal,
# making the two equivalent.
